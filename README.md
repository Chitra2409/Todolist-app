# To-Do List Web Application

## Introduction

Welcome to the To-Do List web application! This is a simple web-based task manager that allows you to keep track of your daily tasks and check them off as you complete them. The application is designed using Node.js and Express on the backend, and it uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for rendering the frontend interface.

**Note:** As of the current version, the To-Do List application does not utilize a database, meaning that tasks will not persist between sessions. However, this version still offers a convenient way to organize your daily tasks and manage them effectively.

## Features

- **Task Management:** Add new tasks to your to-do list and check them off when completed.
- **Dynamic Interface:** The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive.
- **Visual Indicators:** Completed tasks are visually indicated with a line-through style.
